## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[sravioli/wezterm Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm/blob/main/.github/code_of_conduct.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to .


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm/wiki).

Before you ask a question, search existing
[issues](https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm/issues). If an issue already
covers the topic but needs more detail, add your question there. It is also
worth checking the WezTerm documentation and search results first.

If you still need help:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide your WezTerm version (`wezterm --version`), OS, and any relevant details about your environment.

Someone will follow up when they can.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report includes enough detail for someone else to reproduce the
problem. Before opening one:

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Check whether the issue comes from an unsupported WezTerm version,
  platform-specific setup, or local override.
- Search the [bug tracker](https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm/issues?q=label%3Abug)
  for the same error.
- Search the web as well, including Stack Overflow, in case the behavior comes
  from WezTerm or the terminal environment.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - WezTerm version (`wezterm --version`)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Error output from WezTerm's debug overlay (`Ctrl+Shift+L`)
  - GPU information if the issue is rendering-related (`wezterm ls-fonts --list-system` or Lantern GPU output)
  - Any relevant files in your `overrides/` directory
  - Your input and the output
  - Whether you can reproduce the issue reliably, and whether older versions
    behave the same way.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to .
<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm/issues/new).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Provide the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow. Include the
  relevant config snippet or a reduced test case when possible.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue.
- A maintainer will try to reproduce it. If the issue does not include enough
  detail, it may be marked `needs-repro`.
- Once the issue is reproducible, it can be marked `needs-fix` and picked up by
  a contributor.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->


### Suggesting Enhancements

Use this section for new feature ideas and smaller improvements to existing
behavior.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm/wiki) and check
  whether the behavior is already possible through configuration or overrides.
- Search existing [issues](https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm/issues). If the
  idea already exists, add context there instead of opening a duplicate.
- Make sure the idea fits the project. Narrow personal workflows may be better
  as an override or standalone plugin.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm/issues).

- Use a clear title.
- Describe the change in concrete steps.
- Explain the current behavior, the behavior you expected, and any alternatives
  that do not work for you.
- Include screenshots or recordings when they make the request easier to
  understand.
- Explain why the change belongs in this config rather than in a personal
  override.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Your First Code Contribution

#### Prerequisites

- [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) formatter (`cargo install stylua` or grab a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua/releases))

#### Setup

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub - either through the GitHub web UI or with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

   ```sh
   gh repo fork sravioli/wezterm --clone=false
   ```

2. **Backup your existing WezTerm config** (if you have one):

   Linux / macOS:
   ```sh
   cp -r ~/.config/wezterm ~/.config/wezterm.bak
   ```

   Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item -Recurse "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\wezterm" "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\wezterm.bak"
   ```

3. **Clone your fork** into the WezTerm config directory:

   Linux / macOS:
   ```sh
   gh repo clone <your-username>/wezterm ~/.config/wezterm
   # or without gh:
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/wezterm.git ~/.config/wezterm
   ```

   Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   gh repo clone <your-username>/wezterm "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\wezterm"
   # or without gh:
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/wezterm.git "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\wezterm"
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > `gh repo clone` automatically sets the `upstream` remote for you. If you used `gh`, you can skip step 4.

4. **Add the upstream remote** (only needed if you cloned with `git clone`):
   ```sh
   cd ~/.config/wezterm   # or $env:USERPROFILE\.config\wezterm on Windows
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm.git
   ```

#### Restoring your original config

When you're done contributing and want to restore your original config, run:

Linux / macOS:
```sh
rm -rf ~/.config/wezterm && mv ~/.config/wezterm.bak ~/.config/wezterm
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\wezterm"
Rename-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\wezterm.bak" "wezterm"
```

#### Architecture overview

This is a modular WezTerm configuration written in Lua. The main pieces are:

- **`wezterm.lua`** - Entry point. Loads events (side-effect), builds the config via `Config:add()` chaining, applies mapping overrides through Chord, then registers Chord commands.
- **`config/`** - Config modules (appearance, font, GPU, tab bar, general). Each returns a table of WezTerm options.
- **`events/`** - WezTerm event handlers (status bar, tab title, window title, etc.). Conditionally loaded based on `Opts`.
- **`mappings/`** - Keybindings using Vim-style notation (`<C-S-a>`, `<leader>w`). Split into `default.lua` (global keys) and `modes.lua` (modal key tables).
- **`opts/`** - Central configuration registry. Controls feature flags, statusbar modules, and local config-builder options. Optional features check `Opts.X.enabled` before loading.
- **`plugs/`** - Central plugin wrappers. Consumer modules require `plugs.<name>` instead of calling `wezterm.plugin.require()` directly.
- **`utils/`** - Shared utilities that remain local to this config: config builder, renderer, bar budget, conditions, color helpers, and assertion helpers.
- **`plugins/`** - Local source checkouts for standalone `.wz` plugins. Published plugins are loaded through `plugs/`.
- **`overrides/`** - **User customization layer.** Each subdirectory (`config/`, `events/`, `mappings/`, `opts/`) is loaded with `pcall(require, "overrides.<module>")`. If the file exists it's merged in, otherwise it's silently skipped.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never modify core files for personal tweaks. Use the `overrides/` directory
> instead. It lets you customize the config without changing upstream files.

#### Key conventions

- **Modules return tables.** Config modules return a table of WezTerm options; event modules register handlers as a side effect.
- **Opts-driven feature flags.** Every optional feature checks `Opts.X.enabled` before loading.
- **Vim-style key notation.** All keybindings use human-readable Vim notation (e.g. `<C-S-c>` for Ctrl+Shift+C).
- **Deep merge strategy.** `tbl.merge("force", base, overrides)` is the standard pattern for merging config tables.

#### Testing changes

WezTerm **live-reloads** the configuration whenever a file changes. To debug:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+L` to open the **debug overlay** - this shows logs, errors, and Lua print output.
2. Check the WezTerm error window that pops up on config parse errors.
3. Use the logger (configured via `Opts`) to add debug output to your modules.

### Improving The Documentation

Documentation lives on the
[GitHub wiki](https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm/wiki). Fixes, clearer
explanations, and focused examples are welcome.

When working on documentation, keep in mind:

- **Documentation license.** All documentation is licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](../LICENSE-DOCS).
- **LuaCATS annotations.** All Lua files use [LuaCATS annotations](https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/) (`---@class`, `---@param`, `---@return`, `---@module`, etc.). Please maintain and update these annotations when modifying code.
- **Changelog.** The `CHANGELOG.md` is **auto-generated** by [Cocogitto](https://docs.cocogitto.io/) from commit messages. Do not edit it manually.

## Styleguides
### Commit Messages

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) enforced by [Cocogitto](https://docs.cocogitto.io/). The full configuration is in [`cog.toml`](../cog.toml).

#### Format

```
type(scope): description
```

Examples:
```
feat(lantern): add Gruvbox colorscheme
fix(statusbar): correct padding calculation on resize
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(chord): simplify modifier parsing
```

#### Commit types

| `release`  | Release commit                       | Releases          |

#### Scopes

Scopes are freeform but should match a directory or feature area: `config`, `events`, `mappings`, `opts`, `lantern`, `chord`, `ribbon`, `sigil`, `utils`, `statusbar`, `plugins`, `renderer`, etc.

#### Additional rules

- **Versioning:** bare SemVer tags without prefix (e.g. `6.3.4`, not `v6.3.4`).
- **Merge commits** are ignored
- **Only `main`** can be version-bumped.

### Code Style

Lua code is formatted with [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua), configured in [`.stylua.toml`](../.stylua.toml). **Run `stylua .` before committing.**

Key settings:

| Setting            | Value              | Notes |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ----- |
| Indent             | 2 spaces           |       |
| Column width       | 90                 | Soft wrap guide |
| Line endings       | Unix (LF)          | Even on Windows |
| Quote style        | `AutoPreferDouble`  | Prefers `"`, falls back to `'` when fewer escapes |
| Call parentheses   | `None`             | Omit parens on single string/table arg calls (e.g. `require "foo"`) |
| Require sorting    | Enabled            | Consecutive `require` blocks are sorted automatically |

Additional guidelines:

- Use [LuaCATS annotations](https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/) for all public functions, classes, and module-level types.
- Use `selene` inline annotations sparingly where needed: `-- selene: allow(unused_variable)`.
- Keep modules focused - one responsibility per file.
