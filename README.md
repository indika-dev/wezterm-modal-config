## Getting started

- **Requirements**:
  - [Wezterm _**nightly**_](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/installation.html)
  - [Fira Code NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com).

  - [Monaspace Krypton](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/releases/latest)

- **Steps**

  ~~~sh
  git clone https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm.git ~/.config/wezterm
  ~~~

  and you're done.

## Features

### Flexible status-bar

<https://github.com/sravioli/wezterm/assets/76562615/990e099d-c933-4f45-89f6-503135341fb9>

This configuration provides a flexible and responsive status bar for WezTerm,
ensuring important information is always visible and adapts gracefully to changes
in terminal size.

The configuration attempts to display the most detailed version of each
status-bar element.  If space is insufficient, it falls back to shorter versions
or omits the element entirely.  It shows the full path, a shortened path, or an
abbreviated path for the current working directory (CWD). For the hostname, it
displays the full hostname or its first letter if space is limited. Date and time
are shown in various formats: full date and time, date in dd/mm format, or
only the time. The battery status is represented by the full battery status with
icon and percentage, percentage only, or icon only.

Compare to stock Wezterm:

### Mode indicator with modal prompts

![showcase help mode prompts](./.github/assets/prompts-help-showcase.png)

![showcase window mode prompts](./.github/assets/prompts-window-showcase.png)

![showcase search mode prompts](./.github/assets/prompts-search-showcase.png)

![showcase copy mode prompts](./.github/assets/prompts-copy-showcase.png)

![showcase font mode prompts](./.github/assets/prompts-font-showcase.png)

The mode indicator highlights the current operational mode of the terminal, such
as copy mode, search mode, window mode, font mode or help (normal) mode.  Each
mode is represented by a distinct label and background color, providing a clear
visual cue.  The mode indicator is positioned on the left side of the status-bar.

The modal prompts enhance the user interface by displaying context-specific key
mappings in the status bar.  When a mode is activated, it shows a series of
prompts to guide the user on available commands. Each prompt includes a key and
its description, styled colors and fonts to improve readability and user
experience.

The mode indicator supports customization through the [`modes`
table](./utils/modes-list.lua), which defines the text label, background color
and mappings prompt and descriptions for each mode.  The configuration listens
for changes in the active key table and updates the mode indicator accordingly.

As for the status-bar, the prompt length gets calculated to ensure it fits within
the available space, then each prompt is formatted with a key (or list of keys)
enclosed in angle brackets (`<key>`) and followed by its description in
italicized text.

Feeling lost?  Type `<leader>h` (or activate any mode) to have a look at the
prompts!

### Vim-style keymaps

The config defines custom key bindings, inspired by Vim's keymap system.

The `<leader>` (`LEADER` for wezterm) key is `<C-Space>` (Ctrl + Space).

Key combinations try to follow the same conventions as Vim, with the added modifier
of `W` that maps to the `SUPER`/`WINDOWS` key.

Switching mode is made possibile using designated leader key combinations:
`<leader>w` for window mode, `<leader>f` for font mode, `<leader>c` for copy mode
and `<leader>s` for search mode.

Additional adjustments and bindings can be effortlessly incorporated to cater to
individual preferences and requirements.  Adding or modifing existing keymaps is
very easy: add (or remove) the desired keymap to the table in
[./mappings/default.lua](./mappings/default.lua). The keymap will be
automatically converted to Wezterm's syntax.

Usage example as follows:

~~~lua
local act = require("wezterm").action
local Config = { keys = {} } ---the wezterm config table

require("utils.fun").map("<M-CR>", act.ToggleFullScreen, Config.keys)

return Config
~~~

the previous mapping will be translated to:

~~~lua
{ key = "Enter", mods = "ALT", action = act.ToggleFullScreen }
~~~
